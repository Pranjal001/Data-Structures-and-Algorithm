## GRAPH
### (1) DFS/DSU - Count No of Component
### (2) BFS - Shortest path / backtracking for printing path.
### (3) DFS/DSU - No of edges required to connect Component/cities.
### (4) BFS - Shortest path and Store parent and backtrack for printing path. 
### (5) Bipartite - 2 Color problem, assign color to node, traverse child, if(visited) check() else dfs;
